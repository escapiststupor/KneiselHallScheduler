# Select

`<Select />` makes managing selections in React easier.

### Best practices

- Sort options (e.g. by alphabetical order) before plugging into this component so that user can find what they are looking for more easily.
- Ensure that options all have distinct IDs.

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Select} />


## Basic usage (controlled)

<Playground>
  <Select
    title="who's smartest?"
    options={[{ID: 'phyllis', text: 'Phyllis'}, {ID: 'phyllis_yen', text: 'Phyllis Yen'}]}
    onChange={console.log}
    value="phyllis"
  />
</Playground>
