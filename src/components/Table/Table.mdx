# Table

Tables make loading actions more obvious and remind users that something is ongoing.

### Best practices

- Whenever there is something going on that might take long (such as sending a network request, or performing a potentially time-consuming action), use a loading indicator.

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Table} />

## Number Table

<Playground>
  <Table data={fakedata} />
</Playground>
