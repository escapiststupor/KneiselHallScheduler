# Input

Inputs make loading actions more obvious and remind users that something is ongoing.

### Best practices

- Whenever there is something going on that might take long (such as sending a network request, or performing a potentially time-consuming action), use a loading indicator.

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Input} />

## Number Input

<Playground>
  <Input width={200} type="number" />
</Playground>

## Text Input

<Playground>
  <Input width={200} type="text" />
</Playground>
